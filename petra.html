                 <li>Petra is believed to have been established in the year 312BC.</li>
                 <p>It is believed that Petra was first established by the Nabateans, an Arab tribe, in the year 312BC and was not known to the western world until the year 1812.</p>
                 <li>Petra was once one of the most important water stops in the middle east.</li>   
                 <p>The hills outside of the city of Petra are home to natural springs and the Nabateans engineered a water irrigation and storage system that allowed them to tap in to this natural source of water and store it for those residing in the city and any visitors stopping on their journey. Because of this system, Petra had some amazing gardens complete with fountains and ponds as well as stunning swimming pools.</p>
                 <li>Only 15% of Petra has been explored.</li>
                 <p>As most of the ancient city lies underground archaeologists have only explored 15% of the site. As earthquake in the year 693AD destroyed many of Petraâ€™s buildings and the water irrigation system.</p>
                 <li>Petra had a population of around 30,000 people.</li>
                 <p>Petra was one a bustling hub for traders due to its position between two popular trade routes. One route linked the red sea to the dead sea and the other linked the Persian gulf to Gaza. Petra was a popular trading route for spices from India, Silks from China and incense from Arabia. As these trade routes shifted over the years the population of Petra began to decline. Today, Petra sees over one million visitors a year and is Jordans most visited tourist attraction.</p>
