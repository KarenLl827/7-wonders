                 <li>The Colosseum was commissioned in around A.D 70-72 by Emperor Vespasian.</li>
                 <p>The Colosseum lies in the heart of Rome, Italy and was commissioned to be a gift to the Roman people by Emperor Vespasian in around A.D 70-72.  In the year A.D 80 the Colosseum was completed and officially opened by Titus, son of Emperor Vespasian and now Emperor of the Roman people. Titus celebrated the opening of the Colosseum with 100 days of games, this included animal fights and the ever-popular gladiator fights. </p>
                 <li>The Colosseum measures 620 by 513 feet (190 by 155 meters).</li>   
                 <p>The Colosseum is the largest amphitheater to be built in ancient Rome measuring 620 x 513 feet (190 x 155 meters) and built out of stone and concrete with marble seating. The Colosseum takes up 6 acers of land and is oval in shape (thought to be for a better viewing experience by spectators). It took 100,000 men to build this grand amphitheater. The Colosseum has a total of 80 entrances and can seat around 50,000 spectators. </p>
                 <li>The Colosseum has 36 trap doors. </li>
                 <p>Beneath the grand ampitheater there are many passages and rooms believed to be where the gladiators and many animals were kept before entering the grand arena and facing the fate that awaited them. For that extra spectator wow factor, there are 36 trap doors in the arena. As well as gladiator and animal fights, naval battles were also held at the Colosseum and this would be flood at a great expense to provide such entertainment for spectators. </p>
                 <li>More than 6 million people flood to the ever-popular attraction each year.</li>
                 <p>Over the years the Colosseum suffered damage from natural phenomenon such as lightening and earthquakes. By the time the ampitheater closed in the 6th century A.D it had already sustained quite a significant amount of damage. After its closure the colosseum was used as a quarry for various other projects such as the building of St Peterâ€™s cathedral. Around one third of the original Colosseum still survives today and is visited by more than 6 million people each year. </p>
